zwl tests here are currently executed on chrome/ff on mac. It is expected that if the
code is inline with selenium, they should work on windows and even on IE.

Once we're done and deployed to server, we'll write tests (not unit tests but full
suites of some sites) and execute them on chrome/ff/ie. If something breaks or look
unexpected, we'll fix that.
